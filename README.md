# 🌿 Plant Disease and Pest Prediction using Deep Learning

An AI-powered system that helps detect plant diseases and pests from leaf images using deep learning. Designed for farmers, researchers, and agriculture enthusiasts to promote healthier crops and reduce losses.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project consists of two deep learning models:
- **Plant Disease Detection**: Detects various diseases in plant leaves using a CNN model trained on the PlantVillage dataset.
- **Pest Detection**: Identifies different pest types using a separate CNN model trained on a custom pest dataset.

The models are integrated into a **Streamlit-based GUI** where users can select the desired prediction task and upload leaf images for instant diagnosis.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Accurate predictions for both diseases and pests
- 🖼️ Simple image upload interface
- 🧠 Separate CNN models for each task
- 🌐 Easily deployable using Streamlit
- 🪶 Lightweight and user-friendly

## 🗂️ Dataset

### 📁 Plant Disease Dataset
- Source: [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- Categories: Healthy, Early Blight, Late Blight, etc.
- Thousands of labeled images.

### 🐛 Pest Dataset
- Custom dataset organized into folders by pest type.
- Categories: Aphid, Beetle, Caterpillar, etc.
- Thousands of labeled images.

## 🎮 How to Use
1. Start the streamlit app: streamlit run app.py
2. In the interface, choose one of the following:
   - 🌿 Plant Disease Detection
   - 🐛 Pest Detection
3. Upload an image of the plant leaf and get a prediction result.

## ✨ Future Enhancements
- 📱 Android/iOS mobile app
- 🧬 Include nutrient deficiency detection
- 🌍 Add multilingual support for rural accessibility
